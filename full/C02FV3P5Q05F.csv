seconds.  kalonasupernatural  non homoge,homogenization is a mechanical process that transforms the two separate components of whole fresh milk– cream and low-fat milk–into one smooth beverage. to accomplish this fresh milk is heated and pumped through tiny nozzles at high pressure. the pressure tears the fat globules of the cream into tiny particles which then disperse evenly throughout the low-fat milk. non-homogenized milk does not go through this process. after it sits for 12-24 hours fresh non-homogenized milk separates into a layer of light high-fat cream and a much larger more dense layer of low-fat milk. - google search
