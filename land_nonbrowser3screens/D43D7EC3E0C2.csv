KỲ 1: CÔNG TỐ - HOẠT ĐỘNG “NHÀ NƯỚC VẠCH TỘI” Ở Việt Nam hiện nay, Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân là một cơ quan đóng vai trò rất quan trọng trong Bộ máy nhà nước. Tuy nhiên, chúng ta có lẽ đều biết rằng tiền thân của Viện Kiểm sát đó chính là Viện Công tố. Tên gọi, chức năng và hoạt động của Viện Công tố được quy định chính thức trong Hiến pháp 1946 và đến Hiến pháp 1959 thì Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân ra đời, thay thế cho Viện Công tố. Vậy hai cách gọi này có gì khác nhau và tại sao lại cần phải đổi tên như vậy? Để hiểu rõ vấn đề này, đầu tiên chúng ta cần hiểu khái niệm “công tố” và “kiểm sát” là gì. Công tố (公訴) gồm chữ CÔNG (公) có nghĩa là (1) chung, (2) thuộc về nhà nước, có tính chất nhà nước. Trong trường hợp này ta có thể hiểu “công” chỉ những việc chung thuộc về nhà nước, tức có tính công quyền (quyền lực nhà nước). Và chữ TỐ (訴) có nghĩa là vạch tội, báo cho ai biết điều gì. Ta thường bắt gặp chữ tố trong các cụm từ: tố giác, tố cáo, khởi tố. Như vậy có thể hiểu CÔNG TỐ là sự vạch tội chung của tập thể, cộng đồng, sự vạch tội này có tính quyền lực nhà nước, do một cơ quan công quyền, hay một cá nhân được trao quyền thực hiện. Theo định nghĩa của từ điển Hán Việt thì công tố là một phương thức tố tụng trong lĩnh vực hình sự, theo đó đại biểu quốc gia đưa ra lời buộc tội người phạm pháp trước tòa án và “Công tố viên” chính là người thay mặt quốc gia để đưa ra lời buộc tội. Mô hình công tố hiện nay ở các nước châu Á, trong đó có Việt Nam có sự ảnh hưởng rất lớn từ mô hình tố tụng châu Âu mà đặc biệt là Pháp sau hơn 100 năm thuộc địa. Trong tiếng anh, hoạt động công tố là prosecution, vốn có nguồn gốc từ tiếng Pháp cổ là prosécution, với nghĩa gốc là truy tố. Công tố viên tiếng anh là prosecutor. Tuy nhiên, quốc gia khai sinh mô hình công tố lại sử dụng thuật ngữ procureur để chỉ các công tố viên. Đây là thuật ngữ mượn từ tiếng latin procurrerres (procurateur/procurator), chỉ chức quan quản đốc thời La Mã cổ đại. Procureur có nghĩa gốc ban đầu (TK XIII) là người đại diện (cho ai đó) tham gia tố tụng. Các quan công tố xuất hiện lần đầu tiên ở Pháp vào khoảng thế kỷ XIV, dưới triều vua Philippe le Bel. Họ là các luật sư được chỉ định thực hiện chức năng công tố, theo yêu cầu của nghị viện (tòa án Pháp thời trung cổ). Tên gọi “procureur” và vai trò của các công tố viên này được lấy cảm hứng từ mô hình tố tụng thẩm vấn của Tòa án dị giáo (mô hình tòa án của Giáo hội) lúc bấy giờ. Đặc điểm nổi bật nhất trong mô hình công tố của nhiều nước trên thế giới hiện nay vẫn là hoạt động truy cứu trách nhiệm hình sự - chức năng buộc tội trong tố tụng hình sự nhằm bảo đảm sự tuân thủ Luật hình sự. Hoạt động giám sát tuân thủ pháp luật chỉ thể hiện trong quan hệ với cơ quan điều tra, Viện Công tố không thực hiện chức năng giám sát tuân theo pháp luật ở giai đoạn xét xử. Ở giai đoạn này thì Viện Công tố hay Công tố viên chỉ thuần túy là một bên tranh tụng bình đẳng với bên bào chữa. Một điểm thú vị mà chúng tôi từng đề cập ở bài viết về kháng cáo-kháng nghị, đó là Việt Nam chịu ảnh hưởng của hệ thống tố tụng Pháp, nên cơ quan công tố (ở Việt Nam là Viện Kiểm sát) có quyền kháng nghị bản án. Còn cơ quan công tố ở các nước theo hệ thống thông luật thì không tồn tại quyền này. -- Tác giả: Linh – Anh Ảnh minh họa: Công tố viên Hàn Quốc -- Tài liệu tham khảo: Từ điển Hán nôm Từ điển oxford, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prosecution Kho dữ liệu tiếng Pháp số hóa, http://cnrtl.fr/definition/dmf/procureur Wikitionnaire, https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/procureur https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procureur_de_la_République_(France) | Facebook - Google Chrome",procurator la mã - google search - google chrome,766

KỲ 1: CÔNG TỐ - HOẠT ĐỘNG “NHÀ NƯỚC VẠCH TỘI” Ở Việt Nam hiện nay, Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân là một cơ quan đóng vai trò rất quan trọng trong Bộ máy nhà nước. Tuy nhiên, chúng ta có lẽ đều biết rằng tiền thân của Viện Kiểm sát đó chính là Viện Công tố. Tên gọi, chức năng và hoạt động của Viện Công tố được quy định chính thức trong Hiến pháp 1946 và đến Hiến pháp 1959 thì Viện Kiểm sát nhân dân ra đời, thay thế cho Viện Công tố. Vậy hai cách gọi này có gì khác nhau và tại sao lại cần phải đổi tên như vậy? Để hiểu rõ vấn đề này, đầu tiên chúng ta cần hiểu khái niệm “công tố” và “kiểm sát” là gì. Công tố (公訴) gồm chữ CÔNG (公) có nghĩa là (1) chung, (2) thuộc về nhà nước, có tính chất nhà nước. Trong trường hợp này ta có thể hiểu “công” chỉ những việc chung thuộc về nhà nước, tức có tính công quyền (quyền lực nhà nước). Và chữ TỐ (訴) có nghĩa là vạch tội, báo cho ai biết điều gì. Ta thường bắt gặp chữ tố trong các cụm từ: tố giác, tố cáo, khởi tố. Như vậy có thể hiểu CÔNG TỐ là sự vạch tội chung của tập thể, cộng đồng, sự vạch tội này có tính quyền lực nhà nước, do một cơ quan công quyền, hay một cá nhân được trao quyền thực hiện. Theo định nghĩa của từ điển Hán Việt thì công tố là một phương thức tố tụng trong lĩnh vực hình sự, theo đó đại biểu quốc gia đưa ra lời buộc tội người phạm pháp trước tòa án và “Công tố viên” chính là người thay mặt quốc gia để đưa ra lời buộc tội. Mô hình công tố hiện nay ở các nước châu Á, trong đó có Việt Nam có sự ảnh hưởng rất lớn từ mô hình tố tụng châu Âu mà đặc biệt là Pháp sau hơn 100 năm thuộc địa. Trong tiếng anh, hoạt động công tố là prosecution, vốn có nguồn gốc từ tiếng Pháp cổ là prosécution, với nghĩa gốc là truy tố. Công tố viên tiếng anh là prosecutor. Tuy nhiên, quốc gia khai sinh mô hình công tố lại sử dụng thuật ngữ procureur để chỉ các công tố viên. Đây là thuật ngữ mượn từ tiếng latin procurrerres (procurateur/procurator), chỉ chức quan quản đốc thời La Mã cổ đại. Procureur có nghĩa gốc ban đầu (TK XIII) là người đại diện (cho ai đó) tham gia tố tụng. Các quan công tố xuất hiện lần đầu tiên ở Pháp vào khoảng thế kỷ XIV, dưới triều vua Philippe le Bel. Họ là các luật sư được chỉ định thực hiện chức năng công tố, theo yêu cầu của nghị viện (tòa án Pháp thời trung cổ). Tên gọi “procureur” và vai trò của các công tố viên này được lấy cảm hứng từ mô hình tố tụng thẩm vấn của Tòa án dị giáo (mô hình tòa án của Giáo hội) lúc bấy giờ. Đặc điểm nổi bật nhất trong mô hình công tố của nhiều nước trên thế giới hiện nay vẫn là hoạt động truy cứu trách nhiệm hình sự - chức năng buộc tội trong tố tụng hình sự nhằm bảo đảm sự tuân thủ Luật hình sự. Hoạt động giám sát tuân thủ pháp luật chỉ thể hiện trong quan hệ với cơ quan điều tra, Viện Công tố không thực hiện chức năng giám sát tuân theo pháp luật ở giai đoạn xét xử. Ở giai đoạn này thì Viện Công tố hay Công tố viên chỉ thuần túy là một bên tranh tụng bình đẳng với bên bào chữa. Một điểm thú vị mà chúng tôi từng đề cập ở bài viết về kháng cáo-kháng nghị, đó là Việt Nam chịu ảnh hưởng của hệ thống tố tụng Pháp, nên cơ quan công tố (ở Việt Nam là Viện Kiểm sát) có quyền kháng nghị bản án. Còn cơ quan công tố ở các nước theo hệ thống thông luật thì không tồn tại quyền này. -- Tác giả: Linh – Anh Ảnh minh họa: Công tố viên Hàn Quốc -- Tài liệu tham khảo: Từ điển Hán nôm Từ điển oxford, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prosecution Kho dữ liệu tiếng Pháp số hóa, http://cnrtl.fr/definition/dmf/procureur Wikitionnaire, https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/procureur https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procureur_de_la_République_(France) | Facebook - Google Chrome",quan procurator la mã - google search - google chrome,807
