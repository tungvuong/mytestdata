uses applications gps. farmers have specific season for planting weeding and harvesting and due the repeat the. seasons they put the gps receiver their tractors and other farming equipment this allows them. map their plantations and ensure that they return precisely the same time when planting weeding. the next season this strategy effective especially seasons when foggy with less visibility. since the machine will still operate since its gps and not visual reference guides more its high. accuracy makes suitable for use mapping soil sample locations and the farmers can locate the. areas that have soils suitable for farming. this one field that intensively uses the gps app especially since there are numerous braches and. departments the science field and this include physics biology and earth science mention few. before the invention this app scientists used metal and plastic bands tag animals and they would. follow them various location while monitoring them however since the invention and enhancement. the navigation app has helped scientist fit the animal with the collars and the app can. automatically record the animal movement and the information transmitted through satellite. the researchers this means that they can trace the location the animals movement without having. relocate them physically most the sciences taught schools will have more practical evidence. especially since gps provides accurate data earth scientist also uses the app study how landscapes. change over time any geographic area that they may interested,sixt com magazine tips top free
